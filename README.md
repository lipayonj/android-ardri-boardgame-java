“Ard Ri” meaning "High King" is a traditional Scottish tafl game. 
Its rules are much better established seemingly than some of the 
other games of the tafl family (BoardGameGeek, LLC, nd). It is 
played on a 7x7 grid.

	The game can only be played with two player mode with the help of 
the implementation of the client-server architecture. The two 
player mode can be played if the two users are connected via 
Bluetooth. The game can identify all the valid pieces to move 
and valid move of the piece of the current player. The game is 
only capable to handle the human player’s setup thus; artificial 
intelligence implementation is not included. The effective radius 
of Bluetooth is only 5 to 10 meters. Thus, the two players should 
be within 10 meters radius. Android version that is supported of 
this game is from version 2.3 (Gingerbread) and above.

	The “ArdRi” board game reputation as intellectual pursuit was
equal to the other strategic board game just like Dama. Using 
this android application, people who are into board game have 
a chance to learn and play this traditional Scottish board 
game, but rather playing with an actual board, user will play 
this game thru simulation on an android platform.
For most Filipinos, the Android operating system (OS) is the 
mobile OS of choice when it comes to smartphones. In fact 
about 91 percent (nine out of 10) smartphones sold in the 
Philippines run on Android, according to a survey by research 
by GfK (Gesellschaft für Konsumforschung (Society for Consumer Research)). 
According to GfK, the Philippines has the highest Android penetration 
rate in the six countries in the Southeast Asian region, the survey 
said (Pinaroc, 2013). Thus, Android handset is the perfect media to 
game boost the popularity of the “ArdRi” board game.
