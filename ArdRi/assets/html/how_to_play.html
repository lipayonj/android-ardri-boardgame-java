        <h3>Board and Pieces</h3>
        <p>
            Ard Ri is played only by two players, the white player,
            black player and the king (the gray Piece). <br/>
			<p><b>Attacker moves first.</b></p>
			<p>

				</p>
				<p>
					The light square in the center is called the
					"king's square", and only the king may land on
					it. Pieces may not be jumped.
				</p>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The king's square can also
            be used (in place of a piece) to capture the king,
            although the king may be used to capture whether
            a moving piece or not.

		<h3>Piece Moves</h3>
		<p>
			All pieces move in just
			one step along a row or column (no diagonals).
		</p>
		<p>
			A piece may safely move
			between two enemy pieces, though; only the moving
			player may capture.
		</p>

		<h3>Capturing a Piece(s)</h3>
		<p>
			Ordinary pieces
			(but not the king) are captured by being bracketed
			(called custodial capture) by two enemy pieces
			across from each other.

			Captured pieces are removed from
			the board.
		</p>
		<p>
			The king may be captured by
			being surrounded on all four sides by enemy pieces
		or the king's square.
