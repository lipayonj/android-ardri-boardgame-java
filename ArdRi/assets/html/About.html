        <h2>ArdRi</h2>
        <p>
            Ard Ri (Gaelic: High King) was a Scottish tafl variant
            played on a 7Ã—7 board with a king and eight defenders
            against sixteen attackers. It is descended from the
            Norse game Hnefetafl, differing in a few minor details
            and perhaps in board size. The object of the game is
            to capture the defender's king, or to get the king
            to escape by reaching a board edge.
